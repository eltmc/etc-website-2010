<p><strong>Secretary</strong> Take minutes at committee meetings and generally support the committee and the club throughout the year.
This would be an ideal role for anyone wanting either to join or stay on the committee and undertake a role that is enjoyable but not too onerous!</p>
<p><strong>Treasurer </strong>The main duties involve banking cheques, writing cheques and updating the records to produce an income and expenditure account for the year.</p>
<p><strong>Fundraiser </strong>Responsible for raising funds through a variety of means.  This includes running the nearly new sales and approaching businesses for raffle prices or donations for specific equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Membership Secretary </strong>This role is very flexible and can be shared by two people.
The main tasks are administration of the Excel membership database, produce quarterly membership reports for the newsletter, produce short updeates for each committee meeting, manage the annual renewal of each family's membership, send out welcome packs to our new members and put them in contact with other members who live nearby or have twins at the same stage.
Also responsible for collecting all the information for the monthly email and sending it out to members.</p>
<p><strong>Social Convenor </strong>Although usually filled by two committee members, only one is in post at present (any volunteers?).
The main responsibility is to organise a range of events throughout the year for multiples, their siblings and parents.
As well as getting to plan the social calendar for our members, making and confirming the booking with venues, you are also responsible for taking payment for event bookings from members and forwarding the monies on to our Treasurer, as well as paying deposits and balances to venues (always promptly reimbursed by our Treasurer!). 
It is a great position for keeping your organisational skills up to scratch! A full list of contact details for previously booked events will be provided.

<p><strong>Daytime Coordinator, Oxgangs </strong>Duties entail welcoming newcomers, collecting the money, paying for the hall and making sure there are enough biscuits.

Liasing with anyone who has something they wish to sell, or if anyone has any questions - directing these to the mum most likely to know the answer.  Tidy the toys at the end of the session and remind everyone when we the next group will be held.</p>
