        <p>The following Tips are a taster of what existing members of the twins club have found in their time with multiples.</p>
        <p>Remember it is only what worked for those people. Always listen
              to your own instincts and don't be tempted to do what well meaning
              relatives and friends feel you should be doing. You know best and
              sometimes just trial and error will help you find what works for
              your family.</p>
