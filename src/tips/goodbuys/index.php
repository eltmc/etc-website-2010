        <p>Join the Twins and Multiples Club and buy things through the <a href="[% root %]messageboard">messageboard</a> and in the Swap Shop section in the quarterly Newsletter.</p>
        <p>A freezer and microwave are very useful, especially when weaning
                  and for preparing food in advance for adults.</p>
        <p>Rocking car seats, such as the Britax Rock-a-Tot, are perfect
                  for lulling babies to sleep - lying on a double bed with one
                  on either side of you, you can rock them both off to sleep and
                  may even be able to have a nap yourself.</p>
        <p>Boots extra long bath mats are large enough to sit two safely
                  and comfortably.</p>
        <p>A travel cot style playpen provides a safe daytime play space
                  as well as being good for holidays.</p>
