        <p>Don't go out for the first time until you are ready - avoid
                  being rushed.</p>
        <p>The downstairs section of Burger King at the Gyle provides
                  free soft play suitable for 2-5 yrs, this gets very busy at
                  the weekends but is good to break up a shopping trip or to meet
                  up with friends on a wet day.</p>
        <p>The Creche at Ainslie Park Leisure Pool is very good and accepts
                  infants from 3 months. There is a lift up to it and you can have
                  a coffee in the snack bar. Why not treat yourself and have a
                  sauna and steam room session if you are too exhausted to swim?</p>
