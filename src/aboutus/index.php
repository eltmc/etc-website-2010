        <p>
The Edinburgh and Lothians Twins Club is a non-profit support group for those caring for twins and other multiples.  
We have a membership of over 140 families, who we aim to help in a number of ways.  
These include running 3 Babies, Bumps and Toddlers groups, 
and providing a "First Year's" monthly support evening at St Johns Hospital for those expecting or with very young twins. 
</p><p>
We have negotiated a number of discounts for club members with a variety of vendors.
There are regular social events including family days and Mum's and Dad's nights out.
Monthly emails and a quarterly newsletter help keep in touch and provide interesting and funny articles on life with multiples.
We have a messageboard for asking questions, having a chat, finding out ideas for days out, or buying and selling useful baby and toddler items.
</p><p>
Due to demand, we are looking into starting up another First Year's group at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, and a Babies, Bumps and Toddlers group in Comely Bank.</p><p>
The ethos of the club is to bring together and support those blessed with the arrival of more than one bundle of joy.
