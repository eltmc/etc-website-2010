Side-by-side buggies are good in as far as each child can
                  easily see where it is going and has plenty of legroom. Most
                  are now able to fit through a standard doorway, however take
                  your measuring tape when buying to make sure.</p>

Tandem buggies are by far the easiest for gaining access through
                  doorways, along narrow pavements and for getting on and off
                  public transport such as trains or special buses with lowered
                  suspension. They are however heavier than side-by-sides which
                  only becomes a problem when babies become toddlers. Also check
                  it fits in your car before you buy it !!</p>

Triplets - use a double buggy with a front or back pack.</p>
