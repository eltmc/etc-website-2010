Get out and about as much as possible, come to the Twins and Multiples Club
                  regularly and join other local Mother and Baby groups or N.C.T.
                  groups. Having different people to speak to and share experiences
                  with stops you becoming isolated and overwhelmed.</p>

In the early days try to just concentrate on the babies and
                  leave everything else (don't worry about the dusting !)</p>

If things are getting on top of you phone someone from
                    the Twins and Multiples Club. The chairperson may be able to put you in
                    touch with another member who has experienced similar problems
                    if you wish. This could involve anything from problems with
                    breastfeeding twins, Post-natal depression, caring for children
                    with special needs, coping with a multiple pregnancy following
                    IVF or discussing concerns you may have about returning to
                    work.</p>
