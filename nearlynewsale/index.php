<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS" font size="5">Guidelines for selling at the nearly 
  new sale</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">1. Sellers need to contact Torie 
  via nearlynewsale@edinburghtwins.co.uk to gain a seller number. It would be 
  helpful to know about any large items (e.g. cots, buggies) which will be offered 
  for sale with regards to allocating space in the hall. Sellers must be members 
  of Edinburgh Twins Club. Please be aware that there are a fixed number of sellers 
  for each sale.</p><br>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
  2. Seller number 1 will be Edinburgh Twins Club. If you have anything you would 
  like to donate to the club to be sold, please use seller 1. The club will then 
  get the entire proceeds from these items.</p><br>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
  3. Each item to be sold needs to be clearly labelled with a card pinned or stuck 
  onto the item. The seller number should be in the top left hand corner, a brief 
  description of the item in the middle of the card and the price in the 
  New Sales bottom right hand corner to ensure ease of taking payment. </p><br>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
  4. Items which have sold well in previous sales include; buggies, equipment 
  (cots, highchairs etc) toys and books. Clothing does sell but needs to be in 
  excellent condition and reasonably priced. Please also be aware of selling clothing/equipment 
  appropriate to the season. </p><br>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
  5. If possible, clothes should be on hangers (they don&#8217;t need to be labelled 
  for the correct age group, they are just for display purposes) or in sealed 
  plastic bags if sets or multiple items. Multiple items can also be attached 
  together with elastic bands.</p><br>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
  6. Items should be brought to the hall between 9.00 a.m. and 10.00 a.m. and 
  sellers are responsible for placing them on the correct rack (for clothes) or 
  in the correct area for equipment. </p><br>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
  7. All payments will be made at the cashiers&#8217; desks at the end of the 
  sale and remuneration will be made in cash to each individual seller after the 
  club percentage of 10% has been taken.</p><br>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
  8. Any unsold items must be removed at the end of the sale by sellers. Any unclaimed 
  items will be given to charity. </p><br>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
  9. All sellers are asked to stay for the duration of the sale to help with running 
  the cash desks, the caf&eacute; and keeping the tables tidy. At the end of the 
  sale, all sellers are asked to help sort out left over items to ensure that 
  nothing is left over. The sale closes at 12.30 p.m. and we aim to leave the 
  premises by 1 p.m.</p><br>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">
  10. If you wish to pre-advertise any large item, please feel free to do so on 
  the website on the Nearly New Thread on the For Sale Board stating that these 
  items will only be available at the sale. Pictures can be added using photobucket.com. 
  (or any other suitable photograph hosting website)</font></p>
