# Tasks on appointment / resignation
Add or remove:

Welcome email: >
  Hello XXX, welcome to the ETC committee.
  
  I've manually added you to to the ETC committee discussion group on
  Google groups.  This means you will get discussion emails and
  essentially need to do nothing more if that's all you want.  You can
  reply to these emails like normal ones, and the replies will get
  automatically forwarded to everyone else in the group.
  
  However, if you want to view or search the discussions online at
  http://groups.google.com/group/etc-committee, or change any of your
  subscription options, you will need to create an account to log in to
  Google with.  An invitation to log in or create an account will appear
  if you visit that URL without being logged in.

  However, if you're au-fait with Google you may already have a Google
  account, and prefer to use that to manage your subscription to the
  discussion group.  In that case, log in with your account, visit the
  URL above and follow the link "join this group".

  Cheers,
  
  Nick
