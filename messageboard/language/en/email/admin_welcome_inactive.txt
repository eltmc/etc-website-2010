Subject: Welcome to "{SITENAME}"

{WELCOME_MSG}

Please keep this e-mail for your records. Your account information is as follows:

----------------------------
Username: {USERNAME}
Password: {PASSWORD}

Board URL: {U_BOARD}
----------------------------

Your account is currently inactive - the administrator of the board will need to activate it before you can log in. 

However, because the administrator is constantly swamped by fake spam-bot registrations, your registration unfortunately will not be activated unless you reply to this message with some indication that you are a legitimate user of the board and not a malevolent tinned-meat dispenser.  The administrator's job is typically rather dull, so perhaps a joke would seem convincing, plus cheer him/her up at the same time?

Also, please do not forget your password as it has been encrypted in our database and we cannot retrieve it for you. However, should you forget your password you can request a new one which will be activated in the same way as this account.

Sleep well, and thank you for registering.
