<strong>Welcome to the new triplets page</strong> 
<p>My name is Tess Joyce and, along with my husband Michael, I attempt to look after our 2 year old triplets Lizzie, Erin and Norah.</p>

<p>As a member of the Edinburgh and Lothian’s Twins and Multiples Club, you’ll know that carrying, delivering and looking after any level of multiples is a difficult task, with any increase in the number of children adding new challenges and obstacles to the situation.  Logistically, coping with triplets can be that bit more difficult than coping with twins - we only have two arms each after all.  Transportation of the children becomes a major concern, whether it is by car or by buggy – what is the best option?  Sleeping, feeding, changing – the dynamics of having three individuals makes everything a challenge.</p> 

<p>Then there is the composition of the triplets. Are they all boys, all girls, identical or fraternal or a mixture and how does this effect them getting on with each other.  Within our little unit we have a set of identical twins and a singleton and this in itself has given me hours of thought and concern.</p>

<p>My hope for this page, and its related <a href="http://www.edinburghtwins.co.uk/messageboard">message-board</a>, is to provide a source of information, a place to ask questions, a sounding-board for thoughts and ideas and perhaps, most importantly, a space where people can let off steam. I don’t know how many times I have said to Michael that we should have waited until they created babies with “off” switches, but in all honesty I wouldn’t change a thing.  I don’t think either of us has ever smiled so much in our lives and when we see the girls interacting with each other we realise what a wonderful gift we have been given.</p>

<p>Please feel free to email me or give me a call.  It would be really wonderful if we could build up a support network of triplet parents, people who have been through or are going through similar situations.  Support is a vital element when dealing with multiples so please get in touch.</p>
