<h2>Babies, Bumps and Toddlers groups</h2>

<p> There are several Babies Bumps and Toddlers groups based around
Edinburgh and Lothian.  Each group costs &pound;2 per family. If you
are expecting multiples it is well worth popping along to your nearest
group and chatting to the those who already have twins or more.  It is
also a chance to see which pushchairs are the easiest to handle! All
the groups are very happy to welcome new multiple families.  

More information about individual groups follows.  For locations and
directions please see the <a
href="http://www.edinburghtwins.co.uk/groups/map">groups map</a>.
</p>

<p>We had a successful trial meeting at St Stephens Church hall,
<strong>Comely Bank</strong> on Monday 18th February 2008, of our
newest Babies, Bumps and Toddlers group and since then the group has
gone from strength to strength.  The group meets on Mondays from
10am-11:30am every week.</p>

<p>The <strong>Oxgangs</strong> group is the longest established twin
group in Edinburgh, providing a welcoming, relaxed and supportive
atmosphere for all twin mums (including those at bump stage) and
carers. It meets every Thursday from 10-11:30am at the Oxgangs
Neighbourhood Centre, Firrhill Drive (Tel:0131 441 7558), and has a
number of regulars and a wide age-group, from teeny babies through to
pre-schoolers. There are plenty of toys to keep your children amused
(i.e. kitchens, trikes, slides, tunnels).  Soft mats and bouncy chairs
for babies and high chairs are available and the friendly staff in the
centre can provide tea, coffee and snacks.  Plus, we also have a
selection of books for mums which can be lent our during sessions.</p>


<p>The old <strong>South Queensferry</strong> group has relocated to
Corstorphine and has become the <strong>West Edinburgh</strong>
group. The aim is to support families from the surrounding areas, both
within and out with the West side of Edinburgh. The group meets every
Friday morning at 9.30am to 11.30am in St Thomas&apos;s Church,
Glasgow Road, Edinburgh, EH12 8LJ (see this <a
href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?cid=7326416247164003070">map)</a>.
</p>

<p>Parking and access to the group can be found to the rear of St
Thomas&apos;s.  (Take the opening for David Lloyd after the church,
then first left into car park.  Access to the hall through gate at far
end of car park.)</p>)

<p>The <strong>Joppa</strong> group was restarted in 2008 and meets on
Mondays at 10am in St Philip's church hall.</p>

<h2>Other groups</h2>

<p> There are several other groups we know about, but which are not
run by Edinburgh Twins Club.  They are all fantastic places to meet
other mums who are in a similar position.  The details we have are
shown below.  If you notice any mistakes, or know of any other groups
for multiples, please let us know.  </p>

<p> The <strong>Longniddry</strong> group meets on the first and third
Thursday of the month in Longniddry Community Centre, but not on
school holidays.  The centre has a staffed shop selling drinks and
snacks, overlooking the hall, giving a safe environment to chat whilst
looking after babies or toddlers.  There are a range of toys for
babies and toddlers, and enough space for the older children to run
around. There is a soft play area in the centre.</p>

<p> The <strong>Broxburn</strong> group is held at Broxburn Family
Centre every Monday morning from 9.30am - 12pm. Whilst the 3 very
friendly members of staff look after our twins in the activity room,
we can sit round the corner and have a chat over a scone and cup of
tea (great!).  Obviously if one of your twins need you, you are close
enough to pop in and deal with them.</p>

<p> The <strong>Bo'ness</strong> group meets every Thursday morning at
the Playbugs soft-play, Linlithgow, 10.00 till 11.30. We get a good
discount! We have members from Larbert, Falkirk, Bo'ness, Linlithgow,
and being T.A.M.B. mothers we really do think "the more the
merrier". So wherever you are in Central Scotland, bring your babies,
bumps or toddlers and meet some friendly mums who've been through it
all!  </p>
