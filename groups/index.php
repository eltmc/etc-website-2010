<h2>Babies, Bumps and Toddlers groups</h2>

<p> There are several Babies Bumps and Toddlers groups based around
Edinburgh and Lothian.  Each group costs &pound;2 per family. If you
are expecting multiples it is well worth popping along to your nearest
group and chatting to the those who already have twins or more.  It is
also a chance to see which pushchairs are the easiest to handle! All
the groups are very happy to welcome new multiple families.  

More information about individual groups follows.  For locations and
directions please see the <a
href="http://www.edinburghtwins.co.uk/groups/map">groups map</a>.
</p>

<p>We had a successful trial meeting at St Stephens Church hall,
<strong>Comely Bank</strong> on Monday 18th February 2008, of our
newest Babies, Bumps and Toddlers group and since then the group has
gone from strength to strength.  The group meets on Mondays from
10am-11:30am every week.</p>

<p>The <strong>Oxgangs</strong> group is the longest established twin
group in Edinburgh, providing a welcoming, relaxed and supportive
atmosphere for all twin mums (including those at bump stage) and
carers. It meets every Thursday from 10-11:30am at the Oxgangs
Neighbourhood Centre, Firrhill Drive (Tel:0131 441 7558), and has a
number of regulars and a wide age-group, from teeny babies through to
pre-schoolers. There are plenty of toys to keep your children amused
(i.e. kitchens, trikes, slides, tunnels).  Soft mats and bouncy chairs
for babies and high chairs are available and the friendly staff in the
centre can provide tea, coffee and snacks.  Plus, we also have a
selection of books for mums which can be lent our during sessions.</p>


<p>The <strong>South Queensferry</strong> group currently meets every
Friday morning from 10am-noon at the Scout Hut in Port Edgar, South
Queensferry (although see below).  There is an area for babies with
soft toys and baby seats.  For the toddlers there are a selection of
books, toy trains and cars, pushchairs and dolls, push-along toys, and
climb on/in toys such as slides, see-saws, cars and trikes.  Mums,
dads and carers can have a chat with a tea or coffee and a biscuit
(with high chairs for the babies), while the little ones play.  We
also have a special table and chairs for the little ones so they can
enjoy a drink and biscuit too.  Outside we have access to an enclosed
grass area overlooking the Fourth, where the children can play during
the summer.  </p>

<p>However, from <b>Friday 18th February 2011, the South Queensferry
Group will be relocating to St Thomas&apos;s Church, Glasgow Road,
Edinburgh, EH12 8LJ <a
href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?cid=7326416247164003070">(map)</a>.</b>
The new premises are conveniently located to support families from the
surrounding areas, both within and out with the West side of
Edinburgh.  The group will run on Fridays 9.30am - 11.30am.  Parking
and access to the group can be found to the rear of St Thomas&apos;s.
(Take the opening for David Lloyd after the church, then first left
into car park.  Access to the hall through gate at far end of car
park.)</p>

<p>The <strong>Joppa</strong> group was restarted in 2008 and meets on
Mondays at 10am in St Philip's church hall.</p>


<h2><a name="FirstYears"></a>First Year's groups</h2>

<p>There are now two <strong>First Year's groups</strong> these are for
pregnant parents and parents in their first year of raising
multiples. Please bring your babies and we'll help while we chat. We
sometimes have speakers and there is the opportunity to meet others at
the same stage and talk to multiple mums who've been there but whose
children are sleeping so they can concentrate! We hope to make it a
relaxed and open resource. Don't worry about turning up late!<p>

<p>Topics for speakers include such things as:</p>

<ul>
<li>equipment for the first year,
<li>birth experiences, 
<li>sleep,
<li>weaning,
<li>slings,
<li>buggies and prams.
</ul>

<p>These groups offer a good chance to meet other people at the same
stage, and talk to multiple mums who've been there already and can
give advice and support. <!--More information in this Word <a

<p><strong>St John's First Year's Groups</strong> is the original one,
and meets in the Parentcraft Room at St John's Hospital,
Livingston, from 8.00-10.00pm on the first Wednesday of every
month.</p>

<p>A new <strong>Oxgangs First Year's Group</strong> has started in
addition to the other one. This group meets at Oxgangs Neighbourhood
Centre (where the Oxgangs "Babies Bumps and Toddlers" Group meets) on
the second Tuesday of every month, from 8.00-9.30pm (please see the <a
href="http://www.edinburghtwins.co.uk/messageboard/viewforum.php?f=7">First
Year's message board</a> for address and directions/buses). This runs
very similar topics to the established First Year's Group at
St. John's.</p>


<h2>Other groups</h2>

<p> There are several other groups we know about, but which are not
run by Edinburgh Twins Club.  They are all fantastic places to meet
other mums who are in a similar position.  The details we have are
shown below.  If you notice any mistakes, or know of any other groups
for multiples, please let us know.  </p>

<p> The <strong>Longniddry</strong> group meets on the first and third
Thursday of the month in Longniddry Community Centre, but not on
school holidays.  The centre has a staffed shop selling drinks and
snacks, overlooking the hall, giving a safe environment to chat whilst
looking after babies or toddlers.  There are a range of toys for
babies and toddlers, and enough space for the older children to run
around. There is a soft play area in the centre.</p>

<p> The <strong>Broxburn</strong> group is held at Broxburn Family
Centre every Monday morning from 9.30am - 12pm. Whilst the 3 very
friendly members of staff look after our twins in the activity room,
we can sit round the corner and have a chat over a scone and cup of
tea (great!).  Obviously if one of your twins need you, you are close
enough to pop in and deal with them.</p>

<p> The <strong>Bo'ness</strong> group meets every Thursday morning at
the Playbugs soft-play, Linlithgow, 10.00 till 11.30. We get a good
discount! We have members from Larbert, Falkirk, Bo'ness, Linlithgow,
and being T.A.M.B. mothers we really do think "the more the
merrier". So wherever you are in Central Scotland, bring your babies,
bumps or toddlers and meet some friendly mums who've been through it
all!  </p>
