<p> We have three regular Babies, Bumps and Toddler Groups held in
Oxgangs, South Queensferry and St Stephens church hall, Comely Bank.
Each group costs &pound;2 per family. If you are expecting multiples
it is well worth popping along to your nearest group and chatting to
the those who already have twins or more.  It is also a chance to see
which pushchairs are the easiest to handle! All the groups are very
happy to welcome new multiple families.  More information about the
groups is shown below.  For locations and directions please see the
groups <a href="http://www.edinburghtwins.co.uk//groups/map">map</a>.
</p>

<p> We had a successful trial meeting at St Stephens Church hall,
<strong>Comely Bank</strong> on Monday 18th February 2008, of our
newest Babies, Bumps and Toddlers group and since then the group has
gone from strength to strength.  The group meets on Mondays from
10am-11:30am every week.</p>

<p> The <strong>Oxgangs</strong> group meets every Thursday from
10-11:30am at the Oxgangs Neighbourhood Centre, Firrhill Drive
(Tel:0131 441 7558). All families and Mum's-to-be are very
welcome. Meeting other people who understand the joys and hazards of
life with twins has certainly helped me, and it's great to see the
children playing and growing up.  </p>

<p> The <strong>South Queensferry</strong> group meets every Friday
morning from 10am-noon at the Scout Hut in Port Edgar, South
Queensferry.  There is an area for babies with soft toys and baby
seats.  For the toddlers there are a selection of books, toy trains
and cars, pushchairs and dolls, pushalong toys, and climb on/in toys
such as slides, see-saws, cars and trikes.  Mums, dads and carers can
have a chat with a tea or coffee and a biscuit (with high chairs for
the babies), while the little ones play.  We also have a special table
and chairs for the little ones so they can enjoy a drink and biscuit
too.  Outside we have access to an enclosed grass area overlooking the
Fourth, where the children can play during the summer.  </p>

<p> The <strong>First Years Group</strong> meets in the Parentcraft
Room at St Johns Hospital, Livingston, from 8-10pm on the first
Wednesday of every month.  This group is for pregnant parents and
parents in their first year of raising multiples.  Feel free to bring
your babies and we'll help while we chat.  We have different speakers
and topics every month (equipment for the first year, birth
experiences, weaning, buggies and prams etc).  This is a good chance
to meet other people at the same stage and talk to multiple mums
who've been there already and can give advice and support.  There is
some more info in this Word <a
href="http://www.edinburghtwins.co.uk/documents/First_Years.doc">document</a>.
</p>

<p> There are several other groups we know about, but which are not
run by Edinburgh Twins Club.  They are all fantastic places to meet
other mums who are in a similar position.  The details we have are
shown below.  If you notice any mistakes, or know of any other groups
for multiples, please let us know.  </p>

<p> The <strong>Longniddry</strong> group meets on the first and third
Thursday of the month in Longniddry Community Centre, but not on
school holidays.  The centre has a staffed shop selling drinks and
snacks, overlooking the hall, giving a safe environment to chat whilst
looking after babies or toddlers.  There are a range of toys for
babies and toddlers, and enough space for the older children to run
around. There is a soft play area in the centre.</p>

<p> The <strong>Broxburn</strong> group is held at Broxburn Family
Centre every Monday morning from 9.30am - 12pm. Whilst the 3 very
friendly members of staff look after our twins in the activity room,
we can sit round the corner and have a chat over a scone and cup of
tea (great!).  Obviously if one of your twins need you, you are close
enough to pop in and deal with them.</p>

<p> The <strong>Bo'ness</strong> group meets every Thursday morning at
the Playbugs soft-play, Linlithgow, 10.00 till 11.30. We get a good
discount! We have members from Larbert, Falkirk, Bo'ness, Linlithgow,
and being T.A.M.B. mothers we really do think "the more the
merrier". So wherever you are in Central Scotland, bring your babies,
bumps or toddlers and meet some friendly mums who've been through it
all!  </p>

<p>The <strong>Joppa</strong> group was restarted in 2008 and meets on
Mondays at 10am in St Philip's church hall.</p>
