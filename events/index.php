<h2>Christmas Party! Murrayfield Parish Church Hall, 4 December 2010 - <b>CANCELLED</b></h2>

<div>

<p><b>It is with much regret that due to the severe weather conditions,
we have had to make the difficult decision this morning to cancel the
Christmas party scheduled on the 4th December 2010.</b></p>

<p>We are very sorry and hope you don't have too many disappointed
little people!!!</p>
 
<p>With regards to the cheques we have received. None of them have
been banked therefore we will destroy the cheques unless we hear
otherwise from anyone who would like them returned. If you paid cash,
we will arrange for a refund to be sent to you.</p>
 
<p>On a happier note we are organising a ceilidh in the new year for
the children (February) so hope you will all be able to make
it. Details will be available shortly!</p>
 
<p>Hope you all have a lovely Christmas and we see you in the new year
if not before!</p>
 
<p>Best Wishes, Sue Ella, Vicki and Donna</p>
