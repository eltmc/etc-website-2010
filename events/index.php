<h2>Annual Dinner at Vittoria's On The Bridge: Saturday 13th November, 8pm</h2>



<p>Back by popular demand! We welcome all of you to join us for a cosy
chatty meal to mark our <b>Annual Dinner 2010</b>.  We have chosen an
informal annual dinner setting and have booked a table at
<b>Vittoria's Italian Restaurant</b> on George IV Bridge at <b>8pm on
Saturday, 13th November 2010</b>.</p>

<p>Mums and Dads welcome (but we know how much a babysitter costs so call
in those favours!)</p>

<p>Do get a group of you together - either friends or from our toddler
groups - and come and join us for a well deserved night out!  If you
have any questions, reply to the announcement on our <a
href="http://www.edinburghtwins.co.uk/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=335">message
board</a>.</p> 

<p>This venue is much talked about as those that went last time had a
lovely evening - let's have another one! Looking forward to seeing you
there - and as always don't worry about coming late (we also all know
what bedtime can be like) - just come!</p>
